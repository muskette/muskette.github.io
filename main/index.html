                <p>If you've found your way here, you likely saw my email address and looked up my
                    katconsulting.tech domain. I closed the company when I moved to Edinburgh in 2018, but I kept the
                    domain - figured it'll be useful for the separate email address if nothing else.
                </p>
                <p>I'm an Irish expat living in Edinburgh, currently working for a company in Glasgow with some
                    work-from-home flexibility.
                    Looking at my GitHub, you'll probably see my personal tech projects tend toward experimentation in
                    Home Labs and building techy tools for my non-techy hobbies.
                </p>
                <p>Professionally, I've primarily worked in Start-Ups and Financial Technology - Python, Django and
                    databases being my areas of expertise.
                    I'm quite fond of teaching and tutoring junior developers, especially encouraging code readability
                    code and
                    documentation. My development philosophy is heavily influenced by the Zen of Python and the Gang of
                    Four's Design Patterns.
                </p>
                <p>I'm primarily looking into permanent roles, but I'll consider contracts under an umbrella company
                    if the circumstances are right.</p>
                <p>Please feel free to check out my GitHub or CV and reach out via email if you would like to
                    discuss opportunities!</p>
